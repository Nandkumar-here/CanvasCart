# 🎨 CanvasCart

Hey there! 👋 This is **CanvasCart**, a digital artwork storefront I built to explore and learn React development. It's a simulated e-commerce platform where you can check out different digital artworks, add them to a customized cart, and walk through a complete checkout experience.

## 🚀 Built With
- **React.js** (Frontend library)
- **Vite** (Super fast build tool!)
- **CSS3** (Styled from scratch for that personal touch!)

## 🛠️ Features
- **Art Gallery**: Browse through a curated collection of digital art.
- **Shopping Cart**: Real-time updates as you add or remove items.
- **Checkout Flow**: A smooth multi-step process (Shipping -> Payment -> Confirmation).
- **Responsive Design**: Works great on my laptop and phone.
